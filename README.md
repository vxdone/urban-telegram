# DISCLAMER
hello there. i have no idea why you decided to click on this. this respiratory is an online birthday gift for my friends. i usually create a website with content that’s dedicated to them. so please, i ask that you click away and find something else. this respiratory isn’t for you to read. :)

# why do you have this respiratory set as public then?
the only reason i have this set public is because it makes it easier for web hosting. 

# SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. DO NOT TRY TO SPECULATE THE IDENTITIES OF MY FRIENDS OR ME.

seriously, don’t even try at all. that’s just straight up stalking behavior. none of us don’t appreciate you invading our privacy. leave us alone.

2. NO DOXXING PLEASE. 

if you ever find out my real identity, please don't publicly share any personal information online. the last thing i want is for anyone that i know in real life to find about about this.

3. DON'T BE A JERK.

following up with the last term, i really will not appreicate it if you make fun of me for doing this online. i just want to create my birthday gifts in peace and want my friends to be happy. is that too hard to ask?

# PLEASE LEAVE.
still here? thanks for taking your time to read this, it's appreciated. now as the section title suggests, go find something else productive to do. read a book, go outside, do some chores around the house... just anything really. go along with your day and mind your own business. thanks.
